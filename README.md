This my current fork of Eigen 3.3.7 to run on an ESP32, I expect little changes from the original port, but some may happen as things develop and bugs show up, as of 29.10.20 the library does compile and work on esp32.


# Eigen-v3.3.7
A port of the Eigen linear algebra library for Arduino

This is a port of Eigen 3.3.7. This library is known to work with Teensy 3.x, Teensy LC, STM32L4 Ladybug, and Arduino Due devices.

To install, simply clone or download this library into your Arduino/libraries folder. Please see Eigen's website for documentation.

**Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.**
